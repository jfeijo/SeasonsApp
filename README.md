# SeasonsApp
An app that get's to know whether it's cold or warm outside based on your location and latitude.

## Purpose
It was created as a project from Stephen Grider's React + Redux course on Udemy!
It seems silly at glance, but in a introductory level, really helped me to grasp some of the React foundation.
